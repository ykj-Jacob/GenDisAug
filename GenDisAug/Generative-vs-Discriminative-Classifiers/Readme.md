This repository contains the official implementation for the paper **"Generative or Discriminative? Revisiting Text Classification in the Era of Transformers"** by Siva Rajesh Kasa et al.

## 📖 Abstract

The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Automated Setup

Use our setup script for easy environment configuration:

```bash
# Check prerequisites and list approaches
python setup.py --check
python setup.py --list

# Setup your chosen approach
python setup.py --approach ar          # Autoregressive models
python setup.py --approach diffusion  # Diffusion models  
python setup.py --approach encoder    # Encoder models
```

### Quick Demo

Run a quick demo to verify your setup:

```bash
# Automated comprehensive demo (recommended)
./examples/run_comprehensive_experiments.sh demo
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup, note that **diffusion models require a separate conda environment**, while AR, AR-Pseudo, and Encoder/MLM models share a single environment:

#### 1. Shared Environment: AR, AR-Pseudo, and Encoder/MLM Models
```bash
# Create shared environment for AR, AR-Pseudo, and Encoder/MLM approaches
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gendisc-transformers
```

#### 2. Separate Environment: Discrete Diffusion Models
```bash
# Create separate environment for diffusion models
cd diff/
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sedd
```

## 🔬 Experiments

### Autoregressive Classification

Train GPT-based classifiers using generative modeling:

```bash
cd ar/
python train_gpt.py \
    --data_key "SetFit/sst2" \
    --ckpt_dir "./checkpoints/ar_sst2" \
    --model_size "small" \
    --max_epochs 50 \
    --bsz 8
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `--data_key`: Dataset identifier (e.g., "SetFit/sst2", "emotion", "ag_news")
- `--model_size`: Model size ("small", "medium", "full")
- `--n_devices`: Number of GPUs to use
- `--max_len`: Maximum sequence length
- `--seed`: Random seed for reproducibility

### Discrete Diffusion Classification

Train discrete diffusion models for text classification:

```bash
cd diff/
# Single experiment with environment variables
DATASET_NAME="SetFit/sst2" TRAIN_SIZE="1024" N_ITERS="50000" python train.py model=small

# Or run comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and sizes
./run_exps.sh
```

For inference:
```bash
python parallel_inference.py \
    --model_path "path/to/trained/model" \
    --dataset "ag_news" \
    --batch_size 32
```

### Encoder/MLM Classification

Run comprehensive experiments with BERT-based models:

```bash
cd encoder_mlm/
python mlm_classif_seed_fixed.py
```

This script runs experiments across:
- Multiple datasets (emotion, sst2, ag_news, etc.)
- Different model sizes (1 layer, 6 layers, 12 layers)
- Various training sample sizes (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, full)
